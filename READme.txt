A self made list which keeps a record of the work that needs to be done and when needs to be done.
My WorkTracker has a ranged of features such as -
	You can Add your work and the time to do it in just 2 easy steps. 
	You can Delete the record of the work once done. 
	You can Modify the record of a work as per your requirement. 
	The work id automatically sorted according to its time, so that you can focus on the work which needs to be done first. 
	Previous record is saved and it is fetched automatically when you load the page.So you don't have to make the list again when you came back later. 
	A clean and easy to use UI makes time management easy.
